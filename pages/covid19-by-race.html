          <p>
            The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected by the
            California Deparment of Public Health's Coronavirus Science Branche
            and made publically available through an API. The rates were
            calculated with by dividing the number of cases and deaths for each
            racial/ethnic group provided by API by the size of the population.
            The size of the population for each racial/ethnic group was
            calculated by multiplying the California population (39,512,223 --
            https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA ) by the percent that
            racial/ethnic group represents (a figure provide by the API). These
            charts do not include data for COVID-19 cases and deaths that were
            not identified. For more information, visit the
